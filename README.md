**Otpify** is a lightweight, customizable, and easy-to-use SwiftUI library for OTP (One-Time Password) input fields. It supports dynamic OTP lengths, customizable styles, and automatic keyboard dismissal.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic OTP Length**: Set the number of OTP fields dynamically.
- **Customizable Styles**: Adjust the appearance of the OTP fields (width, height, font, colors, etc.).
- **Automatic Keyboard Dismissal**: The keyboard is dismissed automatically when the last field is filled.
- **Focus Handling**: Automatically moves focus between fields as the user types.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures only numeric input is allowed and limits each field to a single character.
